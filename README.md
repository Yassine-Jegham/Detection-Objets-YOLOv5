# Detection-Objets-YOLOv5
This Python script is based on YOLOv5, a real-time object detection model. It supports multiple input sources including images, videos, webcams and screens. The script performs object detection using the specified YOLOv5 model, removes redundant detections, and displays the results with the option to save images or videos. Additionally, it generates a voice message to inform about object detection using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) and playsound. Runtime parameters, such as model, confidence thresholds, and input source, can be configured via command line arguments. This code is ideal for real-time object detection applications and can be customized according to specific project needs.
